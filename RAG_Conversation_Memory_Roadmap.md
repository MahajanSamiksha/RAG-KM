# 🧠 Learning Roadmap: Conversational RAG & Memory in LLMs

This roadmap is designed to help you master conversational memory in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines — both in theory and practical implementation.

---

## 🗓️ Phase 1: Foundations (1 Week)

### ✅ Concepts to Learn
- What is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)?
- How LLMs process context (token window, attention mechanism)
- Short-term vs. long-term memory in chatbots
- Vector embeddings and similarity search

### 📚 Resources
- [📄 RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Facebook AI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.11401)
- [📘 LangChain Memory Concepts (Blog)](https://blog.langchain.dev/understanding-langchain-memory/)
- [📹 LangChain Crash Course (YouTube - James Briggs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QaAFGlgZ0w)

## 🗓️ Phase 2: Hands-on RAG with Conversational Memory (1–2 Weeks)

### ✅ Skills to Build
- Use FAISS or Chroma as vector stores with LangChain
- Implement:
  - `ConversationBufferMemory`
  - `ConversationSummaryMemory`
  - `VectorStoreRetrieverMemory`
- Inject chat history + retrieved docs into LLM prompts

### 📚 Resources

- [📘 LangChain Memory Docs](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/memory)

### 🔄 Example Snippet
```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferMemory

memory = ConversationBufferMemory(return_messages=True)
```

## 🗓️ Phase 3: Deep Dive into Memory Techniques (1 Week)

### ✅ Concepts to Explore
- Token limit strategies: summarization, sliding window
- Chunking + stitching for long document history
- Vector-based memory of past turns
- Memory expiration and history compression

---

## 🗓️ Phase 4: Production-Grade LLM Apps (1–2 Weeks)

### ✅ Skills to Build
- Maintain long-term memory with DB (e.g. Redis, SQLite)
- Implement agent-style workflows (LangChain Agents, planning)
- Stream LLM responses and update context in real-time
- Track user feedback to improve chat quality

### 📚 Resources

- [🧠 LlamaIndex vs. LangChain – Best Practices](https://blog.llamaindex.ai/)
- Extend your current RAG pipeline with memory and agent loop

---

## 🧩 Optional: Go Advanced (Ongoing)

### Explore:
- Personalized memory graphs
- Dynamic context construction
- Hybrid search (dense + keyword)
- Multi-modal memory (text + images)

---

## 🧪 Project: Chat with Your Docs + Memory

🎯 Build a fully featured RAG chatbot:
- Maintain N-turn chat history
- Use memory and retrieval to construct prompts
- Let users give feedback on each answer
- Optional: Add UI with Streamlit or Gradio
